[{"content":"This is my first blog post. I\u0026rsquo;s the first time I\u0026rsquo;m writing something that would be published on my personal web-page. Programmers are used to write hello world programs as first line when they first approach a new language. It\u0026rsquo;s been a long tradition. This is something similiar for me in this moment as I write this.\nI\u0026rsquo;m writing the first blog post in my website, I still have no idea of what I will be talking about in the next posts, they will probably be some thoughs and ideas of things i learn along the way, likely related to tech or University.\nAnyway I aim to write some high-quality content, something the other people would consider as valuable. This first post is just useful to test the functionalities and looks of this small platform.\nSee you in the next posts.\nUPDATE\nI still havenÂ´t got in the habit to write blog post in a regular manner, but i think now i have an activity that could help me to learn more about my fields of interest and also write more on my blog!\nI think that a two-week study of whatever subject I\u0026rsquo;m interested in and write a post for a week in which i explain what I have learned and my own thoughts about it could be a nice idea\nI\u0026rsquo;ll update this when I have more ideas about this.\n","permalink":"https://flecart.github.io/hello-world/","summary":"First blog post","title":"Hello World"}]
