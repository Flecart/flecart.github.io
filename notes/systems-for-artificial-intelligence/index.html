Interest in the area is being quantified as 10k papers per month on the topic, while dollar investments on compute (energy, cooling, sustainability of compute in general) have had a hard time keeping up with the continuous new requests.\nImage from here\nThis is the general pipeline of model development, training, and inference.\nOne note is that the real ML code in this systems is very small, see (Sculley et al. 2015), there are massive maintenance costs in common ML systems.\nData Curation Collection and Cleaning Garbage in -\u003e Garbage out ~old wisdom\nThe first part of every machine learning system is collect and curate good quality data. Work in this part of building machine learning systems mostly consist in:\nAggregating data Identifying correct sources of the data Remove not good data, labeling it so that it has high quality, and similar. Identify anomalies/outliers, and filtering it. Very difficult to distinguish from noise. Fill empty values Having correct labels (e.g. (Deng et al. 2009) initial big effort, which is very expensive) Analyzing preprocessing costs We need to distinguish from online and offline preprocessing requirements. These functions will use lots of resources on the CPU and often become part of the bottleneck (see here), from personal statistics, it was about 30% just for data preprocessing. Sometimes, it also consumes more data than the training itself! The professor Ana Klimovic shows how scaling the preprocessing and training client can speed up sometimes by 100x in some cases, see here.\nImage from the course slides\nModel Development In this section, we want to build a nice model for our problem, design new architectures, tune hyperparameters, and validate the accuracy. There is not so much from the system side that can be said about model development; this is another area of research.\nAutomated searches This is somewhat similar to what fast performance optimization community has done with LAPACK, BLAS, see Fast Linear Algebra.\nWe have: Model search:\nExplore automatically different architectures to find the best one, obviously very performance intensive. Neural Architecture Search, where you could also use things like RL to find the best one. Hyper-parameter tuning:\nSearch for the best hyperparameters for a model batch size, learning rate, number of layers, activation fucntions, optimizers, and other similar things that could be considered to tune this aspect. Training Pipeline The training pipeline is the output of the model development phase. If you do not track all the dependencies, you wont be able to do things like this:\nRetrain models with new data Track data and code for debugging Capture dependencies for deployment Audit training for compliance (e.g., data privacy policies) Then it would also enable for validation and versioning and usually does not need lot of expertise in machine learning, this is the MLOps side of things.\nUsual Training Stages After (Bommasani et al. 2022), we mostly train big ML models and then:\nPretrain: we train the model on a large dataset, usually unsupervised, to learn general features of the data. Fine-tune: we train the model on a smaller dataset, usually supervised, to learn specific features of the data. Alignment: we train the model to align its behavior with human values and preferences or based on some reliability metrics. Continual Training Usually models need to be retrained to\nInclude new data Adapt do domain shifts or data shifts E.g. hairstyle, fashion shifts. Data deletion E.g. GDPR, or similar laws. This means you need to incorporate new training methods starting from an existing one. It is probably difficult to balance different tradeoff, from accuracy to reliability and compliance. For example some threshold to trigger retraining to check for concept drifts. And this would then enable for data selection policies to take the correct data for retraining. See (B{\"o}ther et al. 2025).\nTraining Parallelization Training is one of the most compute intensive parts of the machine learning pipeline. We need to distinguish the data itself with the parameters data (weights of the model most of the time, or hyperparameters and similar things).\nData parallelism: partition the data and run multiple copies of the model, which synchronize to exchange model weight updates.\nAbout model parallelism:\nTensor Parallelism: we divide layer inference across nodes Pipeline Parallelism: We divide models across nodes. Parameter Server This is a classical way to implement distributed training. Basically, every worker has a copy of the model, and they send the gradients to the parameter server, which then aggregates them and sends them back to all workers. This is a good way to implement distributed training, but it has some drawbacks:\nThe parameter server can become a bottleneck, especially if there are many workers. The parameter server can become a single point of failure, which can be problematic if it goes down. AllReduce Parallelism ",

<p>This is the general pipeline of model development, training, and inference.</p>
<p>One note is that the real ML code in this systems is very small, see <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/hash/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Abstract.html">(Sculley et al. 2015)</a>, there are massive maintenance costs in common ML systems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Garbage in -&gt; Garbage out ~<em>old wisdom</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The first part of every machine learning system is collect and curate good quality data.
Work in this part of building machine learning systems mostly consist in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregating data</li>
<li>Identifying correct sources of the data</li>
<li>Remove not good data, labeling it so that it has high quality, and similar.
<ul>
<li>Identify anomalies/outliers, and filtering it. Very difficult to distinguish from noise.</li>
<li>Fill empty values</li>
<li>Having correct labels (e.g. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5206848">(Deng et al. 2009)</a> initial big effort, which is very expensive)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4 id="analyzing-preprocessing-costs">Analyzing preprocessing costs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#analyzing-preprocessing-costs">#</a></h4>
<p>We need to distinguish from <strong>online</strong> and <strong>offline</strong> preprocessing requirements. These functions will use lots of resources on the CPU and often become part of the bottleneck (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04131">here</a>), from personal statistics, it was about 30% just for data preprocessing.
Sometimes, it also consumes more data than the training itself!
The professor Ana Klimovic shows how scaling the preprocessing and training client can speed up sometimes by 100x in some cases, see <a href="https://anakli.inf.ethz.ch/papers/tfdata_service_SoCC23.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="model-development">Model Development<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#model-development">#</a></h3>
<p>In this section, we want to build a nice model for our problem, design new architectures, tune hyperparameters, and validate the accuracy.
There is not so much from the system side that can be said about model development; this is another area of research.</p>
<h4 id="automated-searches">Automated searches<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#automated-searches">#</a></h4>
<p>This is somewhat similar to what fast performance optimization community has done with LAPACK, BLAS, see <a href="/notes/fast-linear-algebra">Fast Linear Algebra</a>.</p>
<p>We have:
<strong>Model search</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore automatically different architectures to find the best one, obviously very performance intensive.</li>
<li>Neural Architecture Search, where you could also use things like RL to find the best one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hyper-parameter tuning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for the best hyperparameters for a model
<ul>
<li>batch size, learning rate,  number of layers, activation fucntions, optimizers, and other similar things that could be considered to tune this aspect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="training-pipeline">Training Pipeline<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#training-pipeline">#</a></h4>
<p>The training pipeline is the output of the model development phase.
If you do not track all the dependencies, you wont be able to do things like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrain models with new data</li>
<li>Track data and code for debugging</li>
<li>Capture dependencies for deployment</li>
<li>Audit training for compliance (e.g., data privacy policies)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then it would also enable for validation and versioning and usually does not need lot of expertise in machine learning, this is the MLOps side of things.</p>
<h4 id="usual-training-stages">Usual Training Stages<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#usual-training-stages">#</a></h4>
<p>After <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258">(Bommasani et al. 2022)</a>, we mostly train big ML models and then:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pretrain</strong>: we train the model on a large dataset, usually unsupervised, to learn general features of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Fine-tune</strong>: we train the model on a smaller dataset, usually supervised, to learn specific features of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment</strong>: we train the model to align its behavior with human values and preferences or based on some reliability metrics.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="continual-training">Continual Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#continual-training">#</a></h4>
<p>Usually models need to be retrained to</p>
<ul>
<li>Include new data</li>
<li>Adapt do domain shifts or data shifts
<ul>
<li>E.g. hairstyle, fashion shifts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data deletion
<ul>
<li>E.g. GDPR, or similar laws.
This means you need to incorporate new training methods starting from an existing one. It is probably difficult to balance different tradeoff, from accuracy to reliability and compliance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example some threshold to trigger retraining to check for concept drifts. And this would then enable for data selection policies to take the correct data for retraining. See <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06254">(B{&quot;o}ther et al. 2025)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="training-parallelization">Training Parallelization<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#training-parallelization">#</a></h3>
<p>Training is one of the most compute intensive parts of the machine learning pipeline.
We need to distinguish the data itself with the parameters data (weights of the model most of the time, or hyperparameters and similar things).</p>
<p><strong>Data parallelism</strong>: partition the data and run multiple copies of the model, which synchronize to exchange model weight updates.</p>
<p>About model parallelism:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tensor Parallelism</strong>: we divide layer inference across nodes</li>
<li><strong>Pipeline Parallelism</strong>: We divide models across nodes.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/notes/Systems for Artificial Intelligence-20250501112925572.webp" style="width: 100%" class="center" alt="Systems for Artificial Intelligence-20250501112925572">
<h4 id="parameter-server">Parameter Server<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#parameter-server">#</a></h4>
<p>This is a classical way to implement distributed training.
<img src="/images/notes/Systems for Artificial Intelligence-20250430162302571.webp" style="width: 100%" class="center" alt="Systems for Artificial Intelligence-20250430162302571"></p>
<p>Basically, every worker has a copy of the model, and they send the gradients to the parameter server, which then aggregates them and sends them back to all workers.
This is a good way to implement distributed training, but it has some drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The parameter server can become a bottleneck, especially if there are many workers.</li>
<li>The parameter server can become a single point of failure, which can be problematic if it goes down.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="allreduce-parallelism">AllReduce Parallelism<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#allreduce-parallelism">#</a></h4>
<p>&lt;a href=&quot;/<a href="https:/medium.com/">Here</a>@niruthiha2000/allreduce-explained-the-key-to-efficient-distributed-training-2cbbcc871832&quot;&gt;https:/medium.com/</a> is a post explaining the all-reduce parallelism.</p>
<p>This is a way to implement distributed training, the GPUs share the exchange directly with each other and gradient aggregation is done across workers.</p>
<p>This is the most common way to implement GPU GPU interconnect thanks to fast networks between GPUs.</p>
<figure class="center">

<figcaption><p style="text-align:center;">Reduce-Scatter phase of an all-reduce parallelism</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next phase is just gathering the weight together so that each worker has the same weights.</p>
<p>Each node sends $n - 1$ messages to other nodes and receives $n - 1$ messages from other nodes, where $n$ is the number of nodes, in both stages.</p>
<p>The total amount of data transferred: $2 × (N−1) × (K/N) = 2K × (N−1)/N$.
In NVIDIA systems, we use NCCL for these kinds of communications.</p>
<h4 id="pipeline-parallelism">Pipeline Parallelism<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pipeline-parallelism">#</a></h4>
<p>Due to data dependencies, it is usually difficult to have high hardware utilization with the standard forward and backward version. This form of parallelism is also called <strong>model parallelism</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pipeline parallelism partitions the layers of a model into multiple stages and distributes them across
the GPUs. While training, two consecutive pipeline stages exchange intermediate activations or gradients with point-topoint communication. Since the point-to-point communication of pipeline parallelism adds small overheads compared to the synchronization of tensor parallelism, the pipeline parallelism degree can increase along with the model size. From <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23l.html">(Kim et al. 2023)</a> paper.</p></blockquote>
<p>Using <strong>micro-batches</strong>, you can improve the utilization of the hardware, it is like pipelining, see <a href="/notes/central-processing-unit">Central Processing Unit</a>, but on a different level. Introduced in <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/hash/093f65e080a295f8076b1c5722a46aa2-Abstract.html">(Huang et al. 2019)</a>. Pipeline parallelism might suffer from stalls (bubbles) due to dependencies and load imbalance
between the devices (imbalanced partitioning).</p>
<img src="/images/notes/Systems for Artificial Intelligence-20250501113842247.webp" style="width: 100%" class="center" alt="Systems for Artificial Intelligence-20250501113842247">
<p>This form of parallelism is useful if you do not have a machine big enough to fit the whole model, but many machines, so you load the weights at each stage of the pipeline to compute the forward pass, pipelining makes the bubble time smaller, thus making the model more efficient.</p>
<p>Needs to communicate a lot less, only the end of one forward or backward, so it&rsquo;s usually done across different nodes, since it&rsquo;s more sparse.</p>
<h4 id="memory-efficient-pipeline">Memory efficient Pipeline<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#memory-efficient-pipeline">#</a></h4>
<p>Another example of a pipeline is <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23l.html">(Kim et al. 2023)</a>, they introduce the one forward and one backward approach, in figure:</p>
<figure class="center">

<figcaption><p style="text-align:center;">Image from the paper: An illustration of a 4-way 1F1B pipeline schedule with eight micro-batches. The memory pressure of each pipeline stage increases during the warmup phase, stays constant at the steady phase, and decreases within the cooldown phase. After the cooldown phase, parameters are updated with accumulated gradients of each micro-batch. A number in either forward or backward denotes the micro-batch index.</p></figcaption>

$$
M(s) = W(s) + A(s)

M(s) = W_{0} + A_{0} \mu(s)

Where $\mu$ is the number of micro batches.</p>
<h4 id="data-parallelism">Data Parallelism<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#data-parallelism">#</a></h4>
<p>This is the easiest method for parallelism: you replicate the model many times as use that to train on different batches of data at the same times. But you can quickly observe if the model takes a lot of data then this is quite consuming in terms of memory.</p>
<h4 id="tensor-parallelism">Tensor Parallelism<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tensor-parallelism">#</a></h4>
<p>Computing different parts of the tensor can be done in parallel, with different parts of the data. Even if a model can fit on a single GPU, it could benefit from tensor parallelism by splitting that part.</p>
<img src="/images/notes/Systems for Artificial Intelligence-20250501114138612.webp" style="width: 100%" class="center" alt="Systems for Artificial Intelligence-20250501114138612">
<p>This is used within a node usually, because it needs to communicate a lot.</p>
<h4 id="sync-or-async-training">Sync or Async Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sync-or-async-training">#</a></h4>
<p>Synchronous training is usually slow, there will be probably <strong>stragglers</strong>, for example see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2408776.2408794">(Dean &amp; Barroso 2013)</a>.
Synchronous training: workers operate in lockstep to update the model weights at each iteration</p>
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous training: each worker independently updates model weights</li>
<li>Synchronous training achieves better model quality, but lower throughput
Accuracy vs. throughput trade-off.
Useful metric: time to train to a target accuracy</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="causes-of-faults">Causes of Faults<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#causes-of-faults">#</a></h4>
<p>Single failures can wipe out entire model parameters and waste lots of compute time. Restarting the training process is quite expensive.
Common problem that make a node fail are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware</li>
<li>Misconfigurations</li>
<li>Network problems</li>
</ul>
<p>A common way to deal with this problem is using <strong>checkpointing</strong>
If you use spot VMs with some GPUs and TPUs, the amount of failures is higher, difficult to ask a GPU in the cloud currently because everybody is asking for that currently.</p>
<h4 id="pipelined-checkpoints">Pipelined Checkpoints<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pipelined-checkpoints">#</a></h4>
<p>Content of this section are introduced in (<a href="/notes/systems-for-artificial-intelligence#mohanCheckFreqFrequentFineGrained2021">(Mohan et al. 2021)</a>).
We want to checkpoint our current model parameters to some <strong>persistent storage</strong>. The problem is how can we balance the time needed to checkpoint and training? We don&rsquo;t want too much overhead due to this part.
<img src="/images/notes/Systems for Artificial Intelligence-20250501114945159.webp" style="width: 100%" class="center" alt="Systems for Artificial Intelligence-20250501114945159"></p>
<p>The idea is to start to copy to RAM after the first update has finished, but then start the computation for the next iteration immediately, and stall only for the remaining time, then disk I/O can be done in parallel.</p>
<p>There are two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snapshot: copy the model parameters to RAM
<ul>
<li>If spare space is available, do it in GPU, which is significantly faster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Persist: copy the model parameters from RAM to persistent storage
The idea is that when we are copying to RAM or disk, we can continue to do computation and not stall.
It uses some algorithm to determine the checkpointing frequency.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is <strong>maximum one</strong> checkpointing operations at a time (maximum roll back is one checkpoint).
The most important idea is that it does it in the middle of the checkpoints. If you checkpoint while the previous one is still running, you <strong>wait until previous checkpoint is finished</strong>.
It saves two orders of magnitude compared to standard epoch checkpointing.</p>
<p>Also it saves epoch id and current number of processed items to provided inter-epoch state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CheckFreq only maintains two checkpoints on disk at any given time; one completed checkpoint
and the other in-flight.</p></blockquote>

This is usually how it&rsquo;s implemented for large scale training of models across clusters of GPUs, for very very big models. So there are lots of infrastructure working with these methods.</p>
<h4 id="fully-sharded-data-parallel">Fully Sharded Data Parallel<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fully-sharded-data-parallel">#</a></h4>
<p>This method reduces the memory usage for training by a lot, but makes implementation more difficult, and more communication overheads. So, it mostly depends on your memory availability regarding this part.
At scale it&rsquo;s not very useful, most of the people would use ZeRO-1 or ZeRO-2 (usually doesn&rsquo;t give a good improvement over the first version).
Here we are talking about <strong>Zero Redundancy Optimizer</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="weight-for-a-single-model-training">Weight for a Single Model Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#weight-for-a-single-model-training">#</a></h4>
<p>Training a model often requires much more memory compared to inference, let&rsquo;s take an example to understand why.</p>
<ul>
<li>Training a <strong>70B parameter model in 16-bit precision</strong> requires storage for:
<ul>
<li><strong>Model weights (FP16):</strong> 2 bytes per parameter</li>
<li><strong>Optimizer states (e.g. Adam):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Two states (e.g. momentum &amp; variance), each in <strong>32-bit (4 bytes)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Total memory per parameter:</strong> <code>2 + 4 + 4 = 10 bytes</code></li>
<li><strong>Total memory requirement:</strong>

<h4 id="comparison-between-training-and-inference">Comparison between training and inference<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#comparison-between-training-and-inference">#</a></h4>
<p>Training: iterate through dataset, compute forward &amp; backward pass

<ul>
<li>Care about high throughput and fast convergence to high accuracy</li>
<li>Inference: compute forward pass on a (small) batch of data</li>

<h4 id="inference-location">Inference location<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#inference-location">#</a></h4>
<p>We can mainly use two types of inference location:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the <strong>edge</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Meaning it is running on your computer, locally, or on the device.</li>
<li>It is probably the best option for privacy and latency.</li>
<li>Yet it raises some challenges for <em>energy consumption</em>, and hardware types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the <strong>cloud</strong>:
- Meaning it is running on a remote server, in the cloud.
- It is probably the best option for scalability and flexibility.
- Yet it raises some challenges for privacy and latency.
- e.g. OpenAI runs its model on Azure Cloud.</li>
