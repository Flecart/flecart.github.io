This will be a set of notes that try to describe what Theory of Mind (ToM) is generally considered to be in the scientific community.\nWhat is Theory of Mind? This term has been popularized by (Premack \u0026 Woodruff 1978) in the study of Chimpanzees. In his seminal article in 1978, Premack describes the theory of mind as the ability of individuals to ascribe mental states of themselves and other individuals, such as sensory perceptions, beliefs, and desires, and the ability to use this knowledge about other individuals to predict their behaviour. Initially, this idea was explored in the study of the cognitive abilities of primates, suggesting their ability to use information to model knowledge of other group members in competitive situations (Tomasello et al. 2003). Later, the concept was exploited to study human beings’ cognitive abilities in their early years of life. This path of exploration gave rise to frameworks for studying Theory of Mind. For example, one approach is “Theory-Theory” (Gopnik \u0026 Wellman 1994), which presupposes the existence of an individual’s implicit theory regarding phenomena around their environment. This initial theory is then refined over time based on the individual’s observations and experiences. The name “theory-theory” happens to be such as it’s a theory about theories. In this framework a ToM inference has no difference from an inference drawn from personal biases and knowledge about the world and other entities’s view. Another approach presupposes the existence of innate thought modules in which ToM develops (Scholl \u0026 Leslie 1999), justifying how this ability seems to develop similarly regardless of the culture in which the individual grows up. One last interesting approach concerns Simulation-Theory: Simulation theory posits that humans comprehend and anticipate others’ mental states and behaviors by using their own cognitive faculties to mentally simulate others’ cognitive processes. In this framework, individuals utilize their own mental processes to simulate those of others by imagining themselves in the others’ situation, thereby generating the thoughts or actions attributed to them. Unlike Theory-Theory, in this case there is no internally represented knowledge structured like a theory.\nWhat are some of the historical influences? Daniel Dennett has put forth some of the early ideas about ToM. In his work on intentional systems (Dennett 1971) he argues how explanations about agentic behaviour can be catalogued into three categories. These are physical stance (explanation by physical laws), design stance (explanation by intelligent design), and intentional stance (explanation by agentic intentionality).\nPhysical Stance The explanation of systems following the physical stance develops an explanation that follows the laws of physics. For example, if the subject of our study is human behaviour, the physical stance would try to reduce it to the brain and then the physical properties of the brain, coming to biology. In this specific case, the explanations are less valuable than a higher-level explanation because observing the physical action potential of the brain is directly transferable to explanations of behaviour. Nonetheless, the physical stance is useful for explaining many natural phenomena, such as lightning, levitation, electromagnetic radiation, etc.\nDesign Stance The design stance follows a functionalist point of view. It assumes that a system was designed by some intelligent agent, e.g. a human, to have a certain function or complete a certain task. Therefore, the system is usually assumed to have a clear design structure that has a goal to accomplish, often similar to what the creator desired to instil. For example, in computer science many systems are modular by design. It is often more useful to understand the behaviour of a system given a specific level of abstraction than trying to observe the electric pulses at the physical level and infer the operation from this information. An electronic circuit is a simple example: all we need to know is the logical function it was designed to compute, not how exactly the current flows in it.\nIntentional Stance This stance is most similar to ToM. It is a precursor of the idea developed in (Premack \u0026 Woodruff 1978) and has influenced McCarthy’s system in (McCarthy 1979). With Intentional Stance, we assume that a system has certain beliefs, intentions and desires and then try to assess how well this explains its behaviour. The programs’ behaviour in artificial systems often aligns with the creator’s intentions. For example, if a system is built to play Go, we can safely assume that its “desire” is to win the game, and its “intention” on every move is to gain the advantage of the other player during the game. There is no need to delve down into the physical layer or the system’s design to explain the system’s general behaviour.\nHow are we trying to imbue machines with ToM? First seminal work in the field follows from (Baker et al. 2011), where the author, following a framework inspired by bayesian ToM, tries to assess a causal structure that explains decision making (something like a follow up from (Baker et al. 2009)).\nReferences [1] Tomasello et al. “Chimpanzees Understand Psychological States – the Question Is Which Ones and to What Extent” Trends in Cognitive Sciences Vol. 7(4), pp. 153–156 2003\n[2] Premack \u0026 Woodruff “Does the Chimpanzee Have a Theory of Mind?” Behavioral and Brain Sciences Vol. 1(4), pp. 515–526 1978\n[3] Dennett “Intentional Systems” The Journal of Philosophy Vol. 68(4), pp. 87–106 1971\n[4] Baker et al. “Bayesian Theory of Mind: Modeling Joint Belief-Desire Attribution” Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society Vol. 33(33) 2011\n[5] Gopnik \u0026 Wellman “The Theory Theory” 1994\n[6] Baker et al. “Action Understanding as Inverse Planning” Cognition Vol. 113(3), pp. 329–349 2009\n[7] McCarthy “Ascribing Mental Qualities To Machines” 1979\n[8] Scholl \u0026 Leslie “Modularity, Development and ‘Theory of Mind’” Mind \u0026 Language Vol. 14(1), pp. 131–153 1999\n",

<p>This term has been popularized by <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/does-the-chimpanzeehave-a-theory-of-mind/1E96B02CD9850016B7C93BC6D2FEF1D0">(Premack &amp; Woodruff 1978)</a> in the study of Chimpanzees.

For example, one approach is &ldquo;<strong>Theory-Theory</strong>&rdquo; <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/mapping-the-mind/theory-theory/5B959278347235DE3177E162C8224BF1">(Gopnik &amp; Wellman 1994)</a>, which presupposes the existence of an individual&rsquo;s implicit theory regarding phenomena around their environment.

These are <strong>physical stance</strong> (explanation by physical laws), <strong>design stance</strong> (explanation by intelligent design), and <strong>intentional stance</strong> (explanation by agentic intentionality).</p>
<h4 id="physical-stance">Physical Stance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#physical-stance">#</a></h4>
<p>The explanation of systems following the physical stance develops an explanation that follows the laws of physics. For example, if the subject of our study is human behaviour, the physical stance would try to reduce it to the brain and then the physical properties of the brain, coming to biology. In this specific case, the explanations are less valuable than a higher-level explanation because observing the physical action potential of the brain is directly transferable to explanations of behaviour.
Nonetheless, the physical stance is useful for explaining many natural phenomena, such as lightning, levitation, electromagnetic radiation, etc.</p>
<h4 id="design-stance">Design Stance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#design-stance">#</a></h4>
<p>The design stance follows a <em>functionalist</em> point of view. It assumes that a system was designed by some intelligent agent, e.g. a human, to have a certain function or complete a certain task. Therefore, the system is usually assumed to have a clear design structure that has a goal to accomplish, often similar to what the creator desired to instil. For example, in computer science many systems are modular by design. It is often more useful to understand the behaviour of a system given a specific level of abstraction than trying to observe the electric pulses at the physical level and infer the operation from this information. An electronic circuit is a simple example: all we need to know is the logical function it was designed to compute, not how exactly the current flows in it.</p>
<h4 id="intentional-stance">Intentional Stance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#intentional-stance">#</a></h4>
<p>This stance is most similar to ToM. It is a precursor of the idea developed in <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/does-the-chimpanzeehave-a-theory-of-mind/1E96B02CD9850016B7C93BC6D2FEF1D0">(Premack &amp; Woodruff 1978)</a> and has influenced McCarthy&rsquo;s system in (McCarthy 1979).
With Intentional Stance, we assume that a system has certain beliefs, intentions and desires and then try to assess how well this explains its behaviour. The programs&rsquo; behaviour in artificial systems often aligns with the creator&rsquo;s intentions. For example, if a system is built to play Go, we can safely assume that its &ldquo;desire&rdquo; is to win the game, and its &ldquo;intention&rdquo; on every move is to gain the advantage of the other player during the game. There is no need to delve down into the physical layer or the system&rsquo;s design to explain the system&rsquo;s general behaviour.</p>

<p>First seminal work in the field follows from <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5rk7z59q">(Baker et al. 2011)</a>, where the author, following a framework inspired by bayesian ToM, tries to assess a <strong>causal structure</strong> that explains decision making (something like a follow up from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027709001607">(Baker et al. 2009)</a>).</p>
