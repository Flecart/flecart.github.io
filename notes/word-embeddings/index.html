We can embed many things, for example, images, audios etc. There are also some multi channel embeddings, for example CLIP embeddings.\nStatic word embeddings Word2Vec The reference paper is (Mikolov et al. 2013). This has been one of the first approaches that attempted to imbue a semantic meaning to the embedding, which is given statically by the context. Usually byte level Tokenization are not able to create meanings. A famous hypothesis states that the meaning of a word depends on the context words, as explained in (Firth). This is also called skip-gram model in this cases we accumulate pairs of words with a fixed context length of 3. Then we want to try to predict the context words by using the focal word. This is why we say this model produces contextual word embeddings.\nWe want to model the context as a log-bilinear model: $$ p(c \\mid w) = \\frac{1}{Z(w)} \\exp(e_{wrd}(w) \\cdot e_{ctx}(c)) $$ Similar model to Log Linear Models.\nIf we have $\\lvert V \\rvert$ words, then we have in this case $2 \\lvert V \\rvert d$ parameters. Where $d$ is the dimension of the embedding. Why do we need two embeddings, one for the word and one of the context? It makes it easier to model the unlikeliness of repeating the word in his context. The difficult thing for this method is scaling because the $Z(w)$ is slow to calculate (this is why later we need sampling methods).\nPer questo usiamo i contextualized word embeddings.\nNegative sampling It’s a way to speed up training for word2vec, doing 600k at the same time was not feasible at the time. Select 2-20 words in the vocabulary that we do not want to predict. 600k because Word2Vec is just a double linear layer, but with 3kk words of input and output.\nThe negative samples are just taking random words from the vocabulary randomly. While the positive samples are the couples of words effectively present.\nI don’t know if I understood it well but I think it samples a certain number of words at a time and updates only the weights involved (so k targets, and the set of weights involved, only those). I don’t know why it’s called negative sampling if this is the idea below.\nNOTE: this is not important, there are many sampling ways that are used to estimate the $Z$. So you can skip this method.\nOther resources Intuitive Youtube Video about Word2Vec Blog pratico\nOther famous embedding models are GloVe and ELMo\nContextualized Embeddings These are state of the art now. We want to have a different word embedding for every context. We usually use Transformers to model these.\nBERT is called “Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers”. 3.3 Billion words (usually used after finetuning), 110 million parameters and 340 million parameters, not so much from today’s standards.\nReferences [1] Mikolov et al. “Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space” 2013\n[2] Firth “Firth, J.

<p>For any $0 < \varepsilon < 1$ and any $k$ bigger than $f(\varepsilon)\log n$ (see the reference for $f(\varepsilon)$ its a simple function).
The for any $n \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ there is a function $f: \mathbb{R}^{d} \to \mathbb{R}^{k}$ such that $\forall x_{i} x_{j} \in A$ we have

It says that the pairwise distances can be preserved (if meaning is relation between different entities, then this is everything that is needed to keep that concept almost unaltered.)</p>
<p>Probably this is a proof but needs to be checked: <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/826d6525-7d06-4822-b514-3c1f6f006a99.">https://chatgpt.com/share/826d6525-7d06-4822-b514-3c1f6f006a99.</a></p>

<h4 id="negative-sampling">Negative sampling<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#negative-sampling">#</a></h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way to speed up training for word2vec, doing 600k at the same time was not feasible at the time. Select 2-20 words in the vocabulary that we do not want to predict.
600k because Word2Vec is just a double linear layer, but with 3kk words of input and output.</p>
<p>The negative samples are just taking random words from the vocabulary randomly. While the positive samples are the couples of words effectively present.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I understood it well but I think it samples a certain number of words at a time and updates only the weights involved (so k targets, and the set of weights involved, only those).
I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s called negative sampling if this is the idea below.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this is not important, there are many sampling ways that are used to estimate the $Z$. So you can skip this method.</p>

<p>These are state of the art now. We want to have a <em>different</em> word embedding for every context. We usually use <a href="/notes/transformers/">Transformers</a> to model these.</p>
<h3 id="bert">BERT<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bert">#</a></h3>
<p>is called &ldquo;Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers&rdquo;.
3.3 Billion words (usually used after finetuning), 110 million parameters and 340 million parameters, not so much from today&rsquo;s standards.</p>
