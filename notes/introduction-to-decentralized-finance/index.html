Uses of Financial Markets
In this section, we answer the question of what financial markets are for.

Raising capital
Equity and Dept: Equity is ownership in a company, while debt is a loan. (there is also a mezzanine).
Price discovery: The process of determining the price of an asset in the marketplace.
Liquidity: pooling people together to have an ease of access to these assets.
Risk management: Managing the risk of the assets.

Risks could be: inflation (uncertainty on the value of the money), interest rate (uncertainty on the value of the money), credit risk (uncertainty on the value of the money), market risk (uncertainty on the value of the money), etc.
This allows hedging risks.


They have a role in economic growth (this is economic theory, we won&rsquo;t delve into this).

The Shareholders of the market

Investors: People that provide capital to governments and companies in exchange of bonds or stocks
Intermediaries: organizations that facilitate these kinds of exchanges
Market data providers: we can see these as intermediaries that sell data about markets (they usually sell licenses, for example Bloomberg does this).
Issuers: organizations that sell financial assets.
Regulators: ensure the market is fair and is working properly (usually government agencies that create the rules).

For example, it is quite difficult to get into the market, from a regulatory point of view.



Collateral and Over-Collateralization
Collateral refers to assets or property that a borrower pledges to a lender as security for a loan. If the borrower fails to repay, the lender has the right to seize or sell the collateral to recover the outstanding debt.">

Collateral and Over-Collateralization Collateral refers to assets or property that a borrower pledges to a lender as security for a loan. If the borrower fails to repay, the lender has the right to seize or sell the collateral to recover the outstanding debt.\nOvercollaterization: Definition: Over-collateralization occurs when a borrower provides collateral exceeding the required amount. For instance, if the collateral requirement is 150%, the borrower must pledge assets worth 150% of the loan amount.\nRisk Mitigation: Adds an extra layer of protection for lenders or investors, reducing the risk of losses in case of default. Enhanced Creditworthiness: Improves the borrower’s credit profile, making the transaction more attractive to lenders and investors. Market Volatility Protection: Serves as a buffer against fluctuations in collateral value due to market volatility. Key Dangers in Financial Markets The financial market is exposed to various risks that can impact investors, institutions, and the overall system. These risks include:\nSystemic Risks – Risks that affect the entire financial system rather than individual institutions. These can stem from market volatility, geopolitical events, or regulatory changes, potentially leading to widespread disruptions. Market Risks – The risk of losses due to fluctuations in market conditions, such as changes in interest rates, exchange rates, or commodity prices. Credit Risks – The possibility of default by borrowers or debt issuers, often driven by financial distress, economic downturns, or declining creditworthiness. Operational Risks – Losses resulting from internal failures within financial institutions, including fraud, human errors, or system malfunctions. Liquidity Risks – The risk that investors cannot buy or sell assets at fair market value due to a lack of market liquidity, potentially causing losses or a decline in portfolio value. Cybersecurity Risks – As financial markets rely increasingly on technology, cyber threats such as data breaches, financial theft, and market disruptions pose significant challenges. Given the wide range of vulnerabilities, both investors and financial institutions must implement effective risk management strategies to safeguard their assets and ensure the stability of the broader financial system.\nDavid Graeber’s Critique of Financial Markets David Graeber, renowned anthropologist, activist, and author, was a vocal critic of the financial markets and their role in the global economy. He argued that financial systems were key drivers of inequality and instability in the world economy.\nDisconnection from the Real Economy: Graeber believed that financial markets had become detached from productive economic activity. They now focused more on profit generation for themselves rather than supporting the broader economy. Prioritizing Financiers Over Stakeholders: According to Graeber, the interests of financiers and speculators increasingly overshadowed those of workers, consumers, and other crucial stakeholders. Complexity and Risk: He argued that financial activities had become so complex that no one fully understood the risks or potential consequences, contributing to instability and unpredictability. Graeber emphasized the need for a more democratic and accountable financial system to address these systemic issues.\nMarket Makers and Their Role in Liquidity Market makers are specialized entities that enhance market liquidity by continuously quoting both buy and sell prices for specific securities. Their primary function is to ensure a liquid market by maintaining active bid and ask orders.\nKey Functions of Market Makers Liquidity Provision: Market makers stand ready to buy and sell assets at publicly quoted prices, ensuring that traders always have a counter-party available. Bid-Ask Spread: They profit from the difference between the bid price (buying price) and ask price (selling price), capturing the spread as compensation for providing liquidity. Price Stability: By consistently participating in trades, market makers help reduce price volatility and narrow the bid-ask spread, facilitating smoother transactions. Reducing Market Impact: They absorb large trades, preventing significant price fluctuations—an essential function for institutional investors executing high-volume transactions. Key assumptions of Markets (1) Rational Expectations: Based on perfect information • Economic actors will not make systematic mistakes in predicting the future (risks) • Everyone uses the «right» model for forecasting • The future can be inferred from the past and present (2) Efficient Financial Market Theory: Asset prices represent the best possible estimates of the risks attached to them • The risk characteristics from financial markets can be inferred from mathematical analysis. • Market discipline can be used as an efficient tool in constraining harmful risk taking. Markets are self-correcting.\nDecentralized Finance A definition of DeFi Decentralized finance (DeFi) generally refers to an open, permissionless and highly interoperable protocol stack built on public smart contract platforms.\nThree important parts of this definition:\nOpen and permissionless Interoperable protocol stack Public smart contracts (it has a coding part) Regulators have not generally been able to define this legally. The main effect is to get rid of intermediaries, so that it is more close to the people and the voters.\nThe Promises of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, holds great promise in transforming the financial ecosystem by offering innovative, inclusive, and efficient solutions. The core promises of DeFi include:\nInclusivity and Access Promise: DeFi aims to provide financial services to individuals globally, including those who are unbanked or underbanked. By leveraging blockchain technology, DeFi has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and individuals who lack access to banking services, enabling greater financial inclusion.\nPermissionless Innovation Promise: DeFi platforms are typically open-source and permissionless, allowing developers to create and deploy financial applications without requiring approval from centralized authorities. This fosters rapid innovation, enabling the creation of diverse financial products that can cater to the specific needs of different users.\nFinancial Empowerment Promise: DeFi empowers individuals by giving them greater control over their financial assets. Users hold the private keys to their funds, allowing them to engage in financial activities without needing traditional intermediaries such as banks or brokers. This self-sovereignty enhances financial independence.\nTransparency Promise: Blockchain technology, the backbone of DeFi, provides transparency by allowing users to trace transactions on a public ledger. This transparency fosters trust and accountability within the financial system, as all activities are verifiable and cannot easily be altered or manipulated.\nReduced Costs Promise: By eliminating intermediaries and automating processes with smart contracts, DeFi has the potential to significantly reduce transaction costs. This applies to various financial services, including remittances, loans, and trading, making financial transactions more affordable and efficient.\nInteroperability Promise: DeFi platforms are built on open and interoperable blockchain networks, enabling different DeFi applications to seamlessly integrate with one another. This interconnectivity helps create a more efficient, cohesive financial ecosystem that can adapt and grow in a flexible manner.\nDecentralized Identity and Privacy Promise: DeFi can utilize decentralized identity solutions, which enhance user privacy and reduce reliance on centralized entities for identity verification. This means users can have greater control over their personal information and decide who can access it, promoting privacy and security.\nLiquidity Provision Promise: DeFi platforms often operate with decentralized exchanges and liquidity pools, allowing users to provide liquidity and earn returns. This creates new opportunities for individuals to participate in the financial ecosystem and earn passive income, contributing to market liquidity.\nThese promises reflect the transformative potential of DeFi, making financial services more inclusive, efficient, and user-centered. However, while DeFi offers these advantages, it also faces challenges and risks that need to be carefully managed as the ecosystem evolves.\nCentralized vs Decentralized Centralized Finance (CeFi) Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Custody Regulated financial intermediaries Self-custody or based on smart contracts Transaction Execution and Settlement Regulated financial intermediaries Via smart contracts Settlement Payment and settlement usually after execution of the trade “Atomic” settlement (immediate execution and settlement) Governance Financial services provider, trading venue, and/or regulator Software code (“code is law”), governance token holders Identity KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements necessitate identification Pseudonymization (anonymity in transactions) Collateral Full collateralization not necessary Overcollateralization (greater collateral than required) Cross Interaction Restricted Interoperability with applications on the same blockchain (settlement layer) The execution times are much faster in DeFi compared to standard finance (seconds instead of days). This is why CeFi was looking at ways to do it faster. Why Overcollaterization?\nMost assets in DeFi are volatile (so overcollaterization gives you security on this). Other way is incentivizing honest behaviour from the other one (more secure). Be more secure against an unknown person. The intermediary Intermediary was a main thing about trust. The main problem with DeFi that it was (perhaps) able to solve is the problem of anarchist trust, how can you trust without an institution or intermediary\nIn traditional finance, intermediaries like banks and brokers ensure trust by validating transactions, providing accountability, and managing risks. However, in decentralized finance (DeFi), intermediaries are removed, creating the challenge of “anarchist trust”, how can participants trust each other without a central authority? DeFi addresses this by using blockchain technology, where transactions are recorded on a transparent, immutable ledger, ensuring security and accountability. Additionally, smart contracts automate transactions, enforcing agreements without the need for intermediaries, and providing trust through decentralized, algorithmic mechanisms. This shift allows individuals to engage in financial activities directly, relying on technology rather than centralized institutions to guarantee outcomes.\nSelected Topics in Private Law: DeFi and Swiss Law Parties of the Contract Under Swiss law, a valid contract requires mutual agreement between two parties, which can also include legal entities. For a contract to exist in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), there must be identifiable parties behind the smart contract. Without a clear, individualizable person or legal entity, no contract can be concluded, as DeFi platforms often operate without traditional intermediaries or explicit identities.\nClaim Possibility Financial harm in DeFi transactions is protected under specific circumstances, including fraud and hacking (e.g., stealing financial assets). However, if a financial loss occurs due to a program error, Swiss law typically does not grant the right to claim compensation. On the other hand, claims for unjust treatment may be pursued, especially when large sums of money are transferred without an explicit or formal contract.\nContractual Claims in DeFi When it comes to contractual claims in the context of DeFi applications, there are certain prerequisites for concluding a contract:\nResponsibility of a party: In traditional contract law, there must be identifiable contracting parties. In DeFi, this is disputed because of the anonymity and pseudonymity inherent in blockchain systems. Without an individual or legal entity behind the smart contract, some argue there is no valid contract. This is why it is often needed to have a physical person or organization for a smart contract to be legally binding. Software usage is not a declaration of intent and is not usually legally binding contract (while taking a bus is).\nTort Claims and Liability Regarding tort claims, liability for damages in DeFi transactions must be based on a violation of protective legal norms, especially those that apply in property law and criminal law. In cases of pecuniary damage, the violation of a legal norm would be necessary for a tort claim to succeed.\nfinancial harms are protected only under certain cases Fraud Hacking (stealing financial assets) If program is error, financial harm is lost in the court. Unjust treatment claim is possible (a lot of money transferred without contract, but one party would need to have suffered significant hram). Unjust Enrichment Claims Unjust enrichment claims, particularly the recovery of financial advantages obtained without a legal basis (referred to as “Leistungskondiktion”), are generally not applicable in the DeFi ecosystem. This is due to the concept of “code is law,” which implies that the smart contract’s terms are automatically executed as intended, with little room for legal recourse. However, there could still be cases where a claim for unjust enrichment might apply if the conditions of the contract are deemed invalid under Swiss law.\nResponsible Courts in Private International Law In the realm of private international law, determining the appropriate court to hear a case, known as jurisdiction. is essential for resolving cross-border disputes. The Swiss Private International Law Act (PILA) provides a comprehensive framework for establishing jurisdiction in such matters.\nChoosing the Jurisdiction: Under Swiss law, parties to a contract have the autonomy to select the jurisdiction that will govern any disputes arising from their agreement. This is facilitated by the PILA, which allows for the designation of a specific court or jurisdiction in the contract itself. However, this freedom is subject to certain limitations, especially when one of the parties is a consumer.\nConsumer Protection: Swiss law offers enhanced protection to consumers to prevent them from being disadvantaged in legal disputes. According to Article 114 of the PILA, a consumer cannot waive their right to sue in their domicile. This means that even if a contract specifies a different jurisdiction, the consumer retains the right to initiate legal proceedings in their home country. Additionally, actions initiated by the supplier can only be brought in the consumer’s domicile, ensuring that consumers are not compelled to litigate in a foreign jurisdiction.\n",

<h4 id="uses-of-financial-markets">Uses of Financial Markets<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#uses-of-financial-markets">#</a></h4>
<p>In this section, we answer the question of what financial markets are for.</p>
<ul>
<li>Raising capital</li>
<li>Equity and Dept: Equity is ownership in a company, while debt is a loan. (there is also a mezzanine).</li>
<li>Price discovery: The process of determining the price of an asset in the marketplace.</li>
<li>Liquidity: pooling people together to have an ease of access to these assets.</li>
<li>Risk management: Managing the risk of the assets.
<ul>
<li>Risks could be: inflation (uncertainty on the value of the money), interest rate (uncertainty on the value of the money), credit risk (uncertainty on the value of the money), market risk (uncertainty on the value of the money), etc.</li>
<li>This allows hedging risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They have a role in economic growth (this is economic theory, we won&rsquo;t delve into this).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-shareholders-of-the-market">The Shareholders of the market<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-shareholders-of-the-market">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investors</strong>: People that provide capital to governments and companies in exchange of bonds or stocks</li>
<li><strong>Intermediaries</strong>: organizations that facilitate these kinds of exchanges</li>
<li><strong>Market data providers</strong>: we can see these as intermediaries that sell data about markets (they usually sell licenses, for example Bloomberg does this).</li>
<li><strong>Issuers</strong>: organizations that sell financial assets.</li>
<li><strong>Regulators</strong>: ensure the market is fair and is working properly (usually government agencies that create the rules).
<ul>
<li>For example, it is quite difficult to get into the market, from a regulatory point of view.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="collateral-and-over-collateralization">Collateral and Over-Collateralization<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#collateral-and-over-collateralization">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Collateral</strong> refers to assets or property that a borrower pledges to a lender as security for a loan. If the borrower fails to repay, the lender has the right to seize or sell the collateral to recover the outstanding debt.</p>
<p><strong>Overcollaterization:</strong>
<strong>Definition:</strong> Over-collateralization occurs when a borrower provides collateral exceeding the required amount. For instance, if the collateral requirement is <strong>150%</strong>, the borrower must pledge assets worth <strong>150% of the loan amount</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> Adds an extra layer of protection for lenders or investors, reducing the risk of losses in case of default.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Creditworthiness:</strong> Improves the borrower’s credit profile, making the transaction more attractive to lenders and investors.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility Protection:</strong> Serves as a buffer against fluctuations in collateral value due to market volatility.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="key-dangers-in-financial-markets">Key Dangers in Financial Markets<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-dangers-in-financial-markets">#</a></h4>
<p>The financial market is exposed to various risks that can impact investors, institutions, and the overall system. These risks include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Systemic Risks</strong> – Risks that affect the entire financial system rather than individual institutions. These can stem from market volatility, geopolitical events, or regulatory changes, potentially leading to widespread disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Market Risks</strong> – The risk of losses due to fluctuations in market conditions, such as changes in <strong>interest rates, exchange rates, or commodity prices</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Risks</strong> – The possibility of default by borrowers or debt issuers, often driven by financial distress, economic downturns, or declining creditworthiness.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Risks</strong> – Losses resulting from internal failures within financial institutions, including fraud, human errors, or system malfunctions.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity Risks</strong> – The risk that investors cannot buy or sell assets at <strong>fair market value</strong> due to a lack of market liquidity, potentially causing losses or a decline in portfolio value.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity Risks</strong> – As financial markets rely increasingly on technology, cyber threats such as <strong>data breaches, financial theft, and market disruptions</strong> pose significant challenges.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the wide range of vulnerabilities, both <strong>investors and financial institutions</strong> must implement effective risk management strategies to safeguard their assets and ensure the stability of the broader financial system.</p>
<h4 id="david-graebers-critique-of-financial-markets">David Graeber&rsquo;s Critique of Financial Markets<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#david-graebers-critique-of-financial-markets">#</a></h4>
<p>David Graeber, renowned anthropologist, activist, and author, was a vocal critic of the financial markets and their role in the global economy. He argued that financial systems were key drivers of <strong>inequality</strong> and <strong>instability</strong> in the world economy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disconnection from the Real Economy:</strong> Graeber believed that financial markets had become detached from productive economic activity. They now focused more on <strong>profit generation</strong> for themselves rather than supporting the broader economy.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing Financiers Over Stakeholders:</strong> According to Graeber, the interests of <strong>financiers</strong> and <strong>speculators</strong> increasingly overshadowed those of workers, consumers, and other crucial stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity and Risk:</strong> He argued that financial activities had become so complex that <strong>no one</strong> fully understood the risks or potential consequences, contributing to instability and unpredictability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Graeber emphasized the need for a <strong>more democratic</strong> and <strong>accountable financial system</strong> to address these systemic issues.</p>
<h3 id="market-makers-and-their-role-in-liquidity">Market Makers and Their Role in Liquidity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#market-makers-and-their-role-in-liquidity">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Market makers</strong> are specialized entities that enhance market liquidity by continuously quoting both <strong>buy</strong> and <strong>sell</strong> prices for specific securities. Their primary function is to ensure a liquid market by maintaining active bid and ask orders.</p>
<h4 id="key-functions-of-market-makers">Key Functions of Market Makers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-functions-of-market-makers">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Liquidity Provision:</strong> Market makers stand ready to buy and sell assets at publicly quoted prices, ensuring that traders always have a counter-party available.</li>
<li><strong>Bid-Ask Spread:</strong> They profit from the difference between the <strong>bid price</strong> (buying price) and <strong>ask price</strong> (selling price), capturing the spread as compensation for providing liquidity.</li>
<li><strong>Price Stability:</strong> By consistently participating in trades, market makers help <strong>reduce price volatility</strong> and narrow the bid-ask spread, facilitating smoother transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing Market Impact:</strong> They absorb large trades, preventing significant price fluctuations—an essential function for institutional investors executing high-volume transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="key-assumptions-of-markets">Key assumptions of Markets<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-assumptions-of-markets">#</a></h4>
<p>(1) <strong>Rational Expectations</strong>: Based on perfect information • Economic actors will not make systematic mistakes in predicting the future (risks) • Everyone uses the «right» model for forecasting • The future can be inferred from the past and present
(2) <strong>Efficient Financial Market Theory:</strong> Asset prices represent the best possible estimates of the risks attached to them • The risk characteristics from financial markets can be inferred from mathematical analysis. • Market discipline can be used as an efficient tool in constraining harmful risk taking. Markets are self-correcting.</p>
<h2 id="decentralized-finance">Decentralized Finance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#decentralized-finance">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="a-definition-of-defi">A definition of DeFi<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-definition-of-defi">#</a></h4>
<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) generally refers to an open, permissionless and highly interoperable protocol stack built on public smart contract platforms.</p>
<p>Three important parts of this definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open and permissionless</li>
<li>Interoperable protocol stack</li>
<li>Public smart contracts (it has a coding part)</li>
</ul>
<p>Regulators have not generally been able to define this legally.
The main effect is to <strong>get rid of intermediaries</strong>, so that it is more close to the people and the voters.</p>
<h4 id="the-promises-of-defi-decentralized-finance">The Promises of DeFi (Decentralized Finance)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-promises-of-defi-decentralized-finance">#</a></h4>
<p>DeFi, short for <strong>Decentralized Finance</strong>, holds great promise in transforming the financial ecosystem by offering innovative, inclusive, and efficient solutions. The core promises of DeFi include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inclusivity and Access</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Promise:</strong> DeFi aims to provide <strong>financial services</strong> to individuals globally, including those who are <strong>unbanked</strong> or <strong>underbanked</strong>. By leveraging blockchain technology, DeFi has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and individuals who lack access to banking services, enabling greater <strong>financial inclusion</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Permissionless Innovation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Promise:</strong> DeFi platforms are typically <strong>open-source</strong> and <strong>permissionless</strong>, allowing developers to create and deploy financial applications without requiring approval from centralized authorities. This fosters <strong>rapid innovation</strong>, enabling the creation of diverse financial products that can cater to the specific needs of different users.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Financial Empowerment</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Promise:</strong> DeFi empowers individuals by giving them <strong>greater control</strong> over their financial assets. Users hold the <strong>private keys</strong> to their funds, allowing them to engage in financial activities without needing traditional intermediaries such as banks or brokers. This self-sovereignty enhances <strong>financial independence</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Promise:</strong> Blockchain technology, the backbone of DeFi, provides <strong>transparency</strong> by allowing users to trace transactions on a <strong>public ledger</strong>. This transparency fosters <strong>trust</strong> and <strong>accountability</strong> within the financial system, as all activities are verifiable and cannot easily be altered or manipulated.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduced Costs</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Promise:</strong> By eliminating intermediaries and automating processes with <strong>smart contracts</strong>, DeFi has the potential to significantly <strong>reduce transaction costs</strong>. This applies to various financial services, including <strong>remittances</strong>, <strong>loans</strong>, and <strong>trading</strong>, making financial transactions more <strong>affordable</strong> and efficient.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Interoperability</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Promise:</strong> DeFi platforms are built on <strong>open and interoperable blockchain networks</strong>, enabling different DeFi applications to seamlessly integrate with one another. This interconnectivity helps create a <strong>more efficient</strong>, cohesive financial ecosystem that can adapt and grow in a flexible manner.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Decentralized Identity and Privacy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Promise:</strong> DeFi can utilize <strong>decentralized identity solutions</strong>, which enhance user <strong>privacy</strong> and reduce reliance on centralized entities for identity verification. This means users can have greater <strong>control</strong> over their personal information and decide who can access it, promoting <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>security</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Liquidity Provision</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Promise:</strong> DeFi platforms often operate with <strong>decentralized exchanges</strong> and <strong>liquidity pools</strong>, allowing users to provide liquidity and earn returns. This creates new <strong>opportunities</strong> for individuals to participate in the financial ecosystem and earn passive income, contributing to <strong>market liquidity</strong>.</p>
<p>These promises reflect the transformative potential of DeFi, making financial services more <strong>inclusive, efficient</strong>, and <strong>user-centered</strong>. However, while DeFi offers these advantages, it also faces challenges and risks that need to be carefully managed as the ecosystem evolves.</p>

<p><strong>Why Overcollaterization?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most assets in DeFi are volatile (so overcollaterization gives you security on this).</li>
<li>Other way is incentivizing honest behaviour from the other one (more secure).</li>
<li>Be more secure against an unknown person.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-intermediary">The intermediary<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-intermediary">#</a></h4>
<p>Intermediary was a main thing about <strong>trust</strong>. The main problem with DeFi that it was (perhaps) able to solve is the problem of <strong>anarchist trust</strong>, how can you trust without an institution or intermediary</p>
<p>In traditional finance, intermediaries like banks and brokers ensure trust by validating transactions, providing accountability, and managing risks. However, in decentralized finance (DeFi), intermediaries are removed, creating the challenge of &ldquo;anarchist trust&rdquo;, how can participants trust each other without a central authority? DeFi addresses this by using blockchain technology, where transactions are recorded on a transparent, immutable ledger, ensuring security and accountability. Additionally, smart contracts automate transactions, enforcing agreements without the need for intermediaries, and providing trust through decentralized, algorithmic mechanisms. This shift allows individuals to engage in financial activities directly, relying on technology rather than centralized institutions to guarantee outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="selected-topics-in-private-law-defi-and-swiss-law">Selected Topics in Private Law: DeFi and Swiss Law<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#selected-topics-in-private-law-defi-and-swiss-law">#</a></h3>
<h4 id="parties-of-the-contract">Parties of the Contract<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#parties-of-the-contract">#</a></h4>
<p>Under Swiss law, a valid contract requires mutual agreement between <strong>two parties</strong>, which can also include legal entities. For a contract to exist in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), there must be <strong>identifiable</strong> parties behind the smart contract.
Without a clear, individualizable person or legal entity, no contract can be concluded, as DeFi platforms often operate without traditional intermediaries or explicit identities.</p>
<h4 id="claim-possibility">Claim Possibility<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#claim-possibility">#</a></h4>
<p>Financial harm in DeFi transactions is protected under specific circumstances, including fraud and hacking (e.g., stealing financial assets). However, if a financial loss occurs due to a program error, Swiss law typically does not grant the right to claim compensation. On the other hand, claims for unjust treatment may be pursued, especially when large sums of money are transferred without an explicit or formal contract.</p>
<h5 id="contractual-claims-in-defi">Contractual Claims in DeFi<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#contractual-claims-in-defi">#</a></h5>
<p>When it comes to <strong>contractual claims</strong> in the context of DeFi applications, there are certain prerequisites for concluding a contract:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Responsibility of a party:</strong> In traditional contract law, there must be <em>identifiable</em> contracting parties. In DeFi, this is disputed because of the anonymity and pseudonymity inherent in blockchain systems. Without an individual or legal entity behind the smart contract, some argue there is no valid contract. This is why it is often needed to have a physical person or organization for a smart contract to be legally binding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Software usage is not a <em>declaration of intent</em> and is not usually legally binding contract (while taking a bus is).</p>
<h5 id="tort-claims-and-liability">Tort Claims and Liability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tort-claims-and-liability">#</a></h5>
<p>Regarding <strong>tort claims</strong>, liability for damages in DeFi transactions must be based on a violation of protective legal norms, especially those that apply in property law and criminal law. In cases of pecuniary damage, the violation of a legal norm would be necessary for a tort claim to succeed.</p>
<ul>
<li>financial harms are protected only under certain cases
<ul>
<li>Fraud</li>

<h5 id="unjust-enrichment-claims">Unjust Enrichment Claims<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#unjust-enrichment-claims">#</a></h5>
<p>Unjust enrichment claims, particularly the recovery of financial advantages obtained without a legal basis (referred to as &ldquo;Leistungskondiktion&rdquo;), are generally not applicable in the DeFi ecosystem. This is due to the concept of &ldquo;<strong>code is law,</strong>&rdquo; which implies that the smart contract’s terms are automatically executed as intended, with little room for legal recourse. However, there could still be cases where a claim for unjust enrichment might apply if the conditions of the contract are deemed invalid under Swiss law.</p>
<h4 id="responsible-courts-in-private-international-law">Responsible Courts in Private International Law<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#responsible-courts-in-private-international-law">#</a></h4>
<p>In the realm of private international law, determining the appropriate court to hear a case, known as <strong>jurisdiction</strong>. is essential for resolving cross-border disputes. The <strong>Swiss Private International Law Act (PILA)</strong> provides a comprehensive framework for establishing jurisdiction in such matters.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Choosing the Jurisdiction</strong>: Under Swiss law, parties to a contract have the autonomy to select the jurisdiction that will govern any disputes arising from their agreement. This is facilitated by the PILA, which allows for the designation of a specific court or jurisdiction in the contract itself. However, this freedom is subject to certain limitations, especially when one of the parties is a consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consumer Protection</strong>: Swiss law offers enhanced protection to consumers to prevent them from being disadvantaged in legal disputes. According to Article 114 of the PILA, a consumer cannot waive their right to sue in their domicile. This means that even if a contract specifies a different jurisdiction, the consumer retains the right to initiate legal proceedings in their home country. Additionally, actions initiated by the supplier can only be brought in the consumer&rsquo;s domicile, ensuring that consumers are not compelled to litigate in a foreign jurisdiction.</p>
