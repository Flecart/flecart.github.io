      <description>This small note is an introduction to Topology that follows the introductory arguments of (Armstrong 2013).
Euler&amp;rsquo;s Theorem Basic definitions Polyhedron It&amp;rsquo;s a collection of plane polygons (see Programmazione lineare#Poliedro) such that:
Every polygon shares each of its edges with exactly another polygon We have vertexes that can be shared by many polygons. Informally we have a piece of surface with a vertex. Theorem statement If we have a Polygon $P$ such that</description>

      <description>This is one of the most basic, but important concepts in topology. We want to define this concept clearly and precisely as a mathematician would do it. These ideas are used in real analysis quite often, but here we want to restate some important things
