      <title>Maximum Entropy Principle</title>

      <description>The maximum entropy principle is one of the most important guiding motives in artificial artificial intelligence. Its roots emerge from a long tradition of probabilistic inference that goes back to Laplace and Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor, i.e. the principle of parsimony.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a simple example taken from Andreas Kraus&amp;rsquo;s Lecture notes in the ETH course of Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence:
Consider a criminal trial with three suspects, A, B, and C. The collected evidence shows that suspect C can not have committed the crime, however it does not yield any information about sus- pects A and B.</description>

      <description>We have a prior $p(\text{model})$, we have a posterior $p(\text{model} \mid \text{data})$, a likelihood $p(\text{data} \mid \text{model})$ and $p(\text{data})$ is called the evidence.
Classical Linear regression Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a classical regression. In this setting we need to estimate a model that is generated from this kind of data: $$ y = w^{T}x + \varepsilon $$ Where $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{n}^{2}I)$ and it&amp;rsquo;s the irreducible noise, an error that cannot be eliminated by any model in the model class, this is also called aleatoric uncertainty.</description>

      <title>On intuitive notions of probability</title>

      <description>This note will mainly attempt to summarize the introduction of some intuitive notions of probability used in common sense human reasoning. Most of what is said here is available here (Jaynes 2003).
Three intuitive notions of probability Jaynes presents some forms of inference that are not possible in classical first order or propositional logic, yet they are frequent in human common sense reasoning. Let&amp;rsquo;s present some rules and some examples along them:</description>

      <title>Gaussians</title>

      <description>Gaussians are one of the most important probability distributions. They arise naturally in the law of large numbers and have some nice properties that we will briefly present and prove here in this note. They are also quite common for Gaussian Processes and the Expectation Maximization algorithm. The best thing if you want to learn this part actually well is section 2.3 of (Bishop 2006), so go there my friend :)</description>
